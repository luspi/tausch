------------------------------------------------------------------

Tausch is a halo exchange library. It provides a unified API for communicating
data between different MPI ranks (CPUs) and between CPUs and GPUs (using
OpenCL).

 REQUIREMENTS
--------------
- CMake (for building Tausch)
- Compiler with support for at least C++11
- OpenCL 1.2 (or later)
- MPI (any implementation should work)

 INSTALL
---------

1) mkdir build && cd build

2) cmake ..

    # Note: This installs Tausch by default into the system program location.
    # To install Tausch into another prefix, add the following parameter:

    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/favorite/path

    # If you require Tausch only for CPU-to-CPU communication and/or don't have
    # OpenCL available on your system, you can disable it using:

    -DOPENCL=false

    # Tausch comes with doxygen documentation, which will be built by default
    # (given that Doxygen is found on your system). You can disable building
    # the documentation using:

    -DDOC=false

3) make && make install


 USAGE
-------
For instructions and examples of how to use Tausch, check the documentation.
Tausch comes with extensive Doxygen documentation, you should be able to find
any information you need in that. If you still can't find what you are looking
for, send me an email: LSpies@illinois.edu
