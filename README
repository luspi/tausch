TAUSCH (c) 2020 Lukas Spies

A halo exchange library for large heterogeneous systems using MPI, OpenCL and CUDA.

It is designed to be maximally flexible (can be used almost anywhere), minimally instrusive (easy
to implement into existing code), maximally efficient (performs just as good or better than any
custom solution), and requires minimal memory resources (compressed halo metadata).

 INSTALL
*********

Tausch is a header-only library and thus does not need to be installed or precompiled in any way.
All that is required is the single header file tausch/tausch.h (for C++ API) or tausch/ctausch.h
(for C API) to be included.

 USAGE
*******

The API of Tausch is very straightforward to use. Please refer to the API documentation(doc
subfolder) for a complete overview.
